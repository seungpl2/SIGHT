# This is Jamiel's test for a notebook

# 2/15/2023 - Writing pseudocode for the microcontroller

All we did today is figure out how to receive signals in c++ and how to create a code skeleton
that receives signals and sends the signals to a handler

# 2/19/2023 - Proposal changes and doppler testing

We incorporated changes in our proposal based off the TA feedback and asked for a resubmission. 
We also got our doppler radar in and started testing 

# 2/20/2023 - Measuring frequency

We used field testing by running and walking to measure reasonable walking and running
speeds for a human being. We eventually were able to calculate what we believe the 
Doppler radar will output. 


# 2/23/2023 - Design Document

We edited our design document to include better detail with our subsystems and also
updated our block diagram

# 2/26/2023

We set up the STM microcontroller IDE and learned how to adjust haptic sensor feedback. 
We are also debugging why our ultrasonic sensor is outputting data on the IDE but the
doppler mosdule isn't
